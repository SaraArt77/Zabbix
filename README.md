I was looking for an SNMP template for Sonicwall Firewalls that discovers only the configured interfaces (with their names and VLANs) and gives me useful information such as the traffic and the status of the interface. I did not find it, so I create one, hoping it will be useful :-) I also created some triggers to alert you when the traffic stops or drops (at first you may need to disable some item you don't want to monitor, e.g. a configured interface that is not used). The linked template Serial number checks the active serial number, useful in HA configuration, it will alert you when the serial number changes (e.g. secondary going active). In this case you will have to close the alert manually.
